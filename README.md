To achieve accurate and real-time FPT prediction, advanced Machine Learning techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are used. A Bidirectional LSTM-based Deep Learning model takes into account all the relevant factors affecting FPT and provides an estimate of FPT for each order in real time.
